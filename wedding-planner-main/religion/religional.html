              the vows. There is usually an engagement solemnized by a monk or Rinpoche. On the wedding day, the bride
              and the groom with their respective families visit the temple, and then, the wedding ceremony is carried
              out at a separate location. A Buddhist wedding is usually a small affair where few friends and relatives
              are invited.
